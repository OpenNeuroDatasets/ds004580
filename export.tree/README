This experiment includes 146 subjects: 98 individuals with Parkinsons disease, 
and 48 controls. Subjects completed  this Simon task (along with multiple other cognitive tasks) 
while EEG was recorded with a 64-channel BrainVision cap. This task included a stimulus presented
to the left or right side of the screen. The researchers instructed participants to press a left key when the 
was yellow or red and a right key when it was cyan or blue. The stimulus was either spatially congruent 
with the screen side matching the response hand or incongruent with the screen side contralateral 
to the response hand. The researchers analyzed data from congruent and incongruent trials separately.
